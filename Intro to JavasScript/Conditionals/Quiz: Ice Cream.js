/*
Directions:
Ice cream is one of the most versatile desserts on the planet because it can be done up so many different ways. Using logical operators, write a series of complex logical 
expressions that prints only if the following conditions are true:

if flavor is set to vanilla or chocolate and
if vessel is set to cone or bowl and
if toppings is set to sprinkles or peanuts
If the above conditions are true, then print out:

I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________.
Fill in the blanks with the flavor of the ice cream, vessel, and toppings. For example,

I'd like two scoops of vanilla ice cream in a cone with peanuts.
TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

If flavor equals "chocolate", vessel equals "cone" and toppings equals "sprinkles", then "I'd like two scoops of chocolate ice cream in a cone with sprinkles." should be
printed to the console.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Ice Cream (3-6)
 *
 * Write a single if statement that logs out the message:
 * 
 * "I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________."
 * 
 * ...only if:
 *   - flavor is "vanilla" or "chocolate"
 *   - vessel is "cone" or "bowl"
 *   - toppings is "sprinkles" or "peanuts"
 *
 * We're only testing the if statement and your boolean operators. 
 * It's okay if the output string doesn't match exactly.
 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * 1. Your code should have the variables `flavor`, `vessel`, and `toppings`
 * 2. Your code should have an `if` statement
 * 3. Your code should use logical expressions
 * 4. Your code should work with 
 *  - `flavor=vanilla`, `vessel=cone`, and `toppings=sprinkles`
 *  - `flavor=vanilla`, `vessel=cone`, and `toppings=peanuts`
 *  - `flavor=vanilla`, `vessel=bowl`, and `toppings=sprinkles`
 *  - `flavor=vanilla`, `vessel=bowl`, and `toppings=peanuts`
 * 
 *  - `flavor=chocolate`, `vessel=cone`, and `toppings=sprinkles`
 *  - `flavor=chocolate`, `vessel=cone`, and `toppings=peanuts`
 *  - `flavor=chocolate`, `vessel=bowl`, and `toppings=sprinkles`
 *  - `flavor=chocolate`, `vessel=bowl`, and `toppings=peanuts`
 *   
 * 5. Your code should NOT log (print) anything when 
 *  - the flavor is something other than "vanilla" or "chocolate"
 *  - the vessel is something other than "cone" or "bowl"
 *  - the toppings is something other than "sprinkles" or "peanuts"
 * 
 * 6. Your code should not be empty
