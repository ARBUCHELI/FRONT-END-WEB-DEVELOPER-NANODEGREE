Directions:
Write a function called laugh() that takes one parameter, num that represents the number of "ha"s to return.

TIP: You might need a loop to solve this!

Here's an example of the output and how to call the function that you will write:

console.log(laugh(3));
Prints: "hahaha!"

Your Code:

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Laugh it Off 2 (5-2)

 *
 * Note:
 *  - make sure your the final character is an exclamation mark ("!")
 *  - make sure that your function produces the correct results when it is called multiple times
 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have a `laugh()` function
 * - Your `laugh()` function should have one parameter named `num`

 */
function laugh(num){
    let risas ="";
    for(let i=0; i < num; i++){
        risas=risas+"ha";
    }
    return risas+"!";
}
console.log(laugh(3));
