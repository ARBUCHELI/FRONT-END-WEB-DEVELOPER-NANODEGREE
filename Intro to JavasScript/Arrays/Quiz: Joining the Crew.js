Directions:
In an earlier exercise, you created a crew array to represent Malâ€™s crew from the hit show Firefly.

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];
Later in the show, Mal takes on three new crew members named "Simon", "River", and "Book". Use the push() method to add the three new crew members to the crew array.

var doctor = "Simon";
var sister = "River";
var shepherd = "Book";
Your Code:

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Joining the Crew (6-6)
 */
/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have a variable `crew`
 * - Your `crew` array should contain the Serenity\'s original crew and the three new crew members
 * - Your code should use the `push()` method to add new members to the `crew` array
 * - Print the array on the console at the end
 */


var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];

var doctor = "Simon";
var sister = "River";
var shepherd = "Book";

// your code goes here
crew.push(doctor, sister, shepherd);
