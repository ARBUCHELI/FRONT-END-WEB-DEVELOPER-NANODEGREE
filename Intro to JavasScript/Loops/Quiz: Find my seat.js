Theater seats often display a row and seat number to help theatergoers find their seats. If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99) in each row, write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.

Example output for row-seat information: output each row and seat number on a separate line

0-0
0-1
0-2
...
25-97
25-98
25-99
Your Code:

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Find my Seat (4-8)
 * 
 * Write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.
 * The first row-seat combination should be 0-0 
 * The last row-seat combination will be 25-99
 * 
 * Things to note: 
 *  - the row and seat numbers start at 0, not 1
 *  - the highest seat number is 99, not 100
 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should use a nested `for` loop'
 * - Your code should produce the expected output, as explained above
 */
 
// Write your code here
for (let i=0; i<26; i++){
    for(let j=0; j<100; j++){
        console.log(i+"-"+j);
    }
}
